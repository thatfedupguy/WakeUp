# WakeUp
WakeUp is an Android app purely built in JAVA. 
The functionality of the app is to keep track of the money spent by the user on a daily basis and show the expenditure in the form of a pie-chart so that you can evaluate where the most of the money is spent and control your budget accordingly.
This app uses Firebase Authentication for the user to log in and Firebase REALTIME Database for storing the userâ€™s data for the day in the form of a Hashmap. 
It also gives a reminder to the user by checking the SMS inbox if there is due electricity, water, phone bill or the money spent on the credit or debit card or money spent from PAYTM wallet.
